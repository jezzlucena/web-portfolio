					<p>Building magical end-user experiences is my true passion. I actively seek out new technologies, and stay up-to-date on the industry's most recent frameworks, languages and trends.</p>
					<p>With a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Engineering and a Master’s degree in Interactive Media & Game Development, continued education has allowed me to stay ahead of the curve and deliver exceptional work to each employer I’ve worked for - both full-time and contract.</p>
					<p>My technical expertise includes cross-platform proficiency (Mac OS, Unix, Linux and Windows); expertise in 13 scripting/programming languages (including ES6, CSS3, HTML5, Phoenix/Elixir and PostgreSQL); and advanced knowledge of developer applications, tools, methodologies and best practices (including OOD, client/server architecture and self-test automation).</p>

						<div class="quote">
							<p>"Jezz and I studied together at Worcester Polytechnic Institute for our MS in Interactive Media and Game Development where we worked together on projects. Jezz is a phenomenal worker and a phenomenal personality to work with. He has a broad base of talents, particularly engineering, writing, design, and criticism, and is a truly deep thinker who is easy to collaborate on and passionate about positivity, authenticity, and morality in the work place.</p>
							<p>The best thing about Jezz as a worker is that he has true, raw talent that he's honed with practice and that he is deeply focused on making positive changes in his community and his industry with that talent and practice. He seeks to learn about others, to understand the theory behind his work, and to act beyond himself. This reflects WPI's motto, "Theory and Practice" which Jezz has truly exemplified in his academic and personal projects."</p>
